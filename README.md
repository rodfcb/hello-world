Ideas, resources and learning

I'm a statistics student interested in programming, math, psychology, and design. Before starting my statistics course I studied psychology, before that I studied graphic design and before that, I studied computer science for a short period.

Right now, I am learning programming skills that could help me start a career in data science after I graduate from my statistics course.

The main languages I am interested in are Python and R. I am particularly excited about data visualization techniques.
